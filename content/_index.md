# Context of Agile

On February 11-13 2001 seventeen people got together in Snowbird, Utah (USA) and from that meeting the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) emerged. They recount some of the history of the creation of the manifesto [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html).

That's now more than 20 years ago and most people who "work agile" today will not be familiar with the historical context of the manifesto. The purpose of this site is **to collect resources** that provide that **historical context, and commentaries on the manifesto and on Agile.**

One aspect of that context that's worth nothing here is that the manifesto was a synthesis of what the authors had uncovered about *"better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."* As such, the manifesto was a crystalization of something that was happening within the software community. For a variety of reasons, not everyone who was uncovering better ways of developing software at that time had the opportunity to contribute to the manifesto.
