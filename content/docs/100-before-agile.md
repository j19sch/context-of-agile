# Before Agile

Managing the Development of Large Software Systems - Dr. Winston W Royce, August 1970  
http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci201/lectures/Lecture11/royce1970.pdf  
*Paper that is often cited as the origin of the waterfall model, while also being very critical of it.*

Software Engineering - Barry Boehm, August 1976  
https://web.archive.org/web/20190910093920/http://csse.usc.edu/TECHRPTS/1976/usccse76-500/usccse76-500.pdf  
*Article by Barry Boehm about the current state of the art and of future trends in software engineering. Section "II. Definitions" contains a diagram of the software life cycle that looks like waterfall. The diagram is very similar to Figure 3 in Royce's 1970 paper, yet Boehm does not cite it.*

Unifying Software Engineering and Systems Engineering - Barry Boehm, March 2000  
https://web.archive.org/web/20170810170441/http://csse.usc.edu/TECHRPTS/2000/usccse2000-506/usccse2000-506.pdf  
*At the start of this article Barry Boehm mentions he "participated in a group at TRW that created a corporate software engineering
culture around the sequential requirements-driven waterfall model. [...]  
We did not realize how effective this culture change was until we tried to undo parts of it a few years later. By the early 1980s, we and other companies realized that the waterfall model was ineffective for developing user-interactive systems, [...]"*

The Leprechauns of Software Engineering - Laurent Bossavit, 2015  
https://leanpub.com/leprechauns  
*Chapter 7: Whoâ€™s afraid of the Big Bad Waterfall? argues that Royce inventing waterfall is a myth.*

Waterfall, Royce and Boehm - Laurent Bossavit, November 2017  
https://twitter.com/Morendil/status/932865620613521408  
*In this Twitter thread Laurent Bossavit argues that we should read Boehm, not Royce, to understand waterfall.*

Agile Converstations - Douglas Squirrel and Jeffrey Fredrick, 2020  
https://agileconversations.com/agile-conversation-book/  
*Chapter 1: Escaping the Software Factory has a few pages on software development in the nineties.*

Getting over the Waterfall, Deconstructing sequential development to better understand more continuous development - Kevlin Henney, August 2021  
https://kevlinhenney.medium.com/getting-over-the-waterfall-c090c6228ca9  
*In this article Kevlin Henney examines the motivation and attraction of sequential development (the waterfall approach) to better understand more agile approaches to software development.*

What is Agile? - James Shore, October 2021  
https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/what_is_agile  
*First chapter of the 2nd edition of James Shore's "The Art of Agile Development"*
