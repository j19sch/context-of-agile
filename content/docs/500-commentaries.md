https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ihLROXzPk  
*Kent Beck and David Farley discuss why waterfall still persists and is perhaps even making a comeback. The power structures haven't changed. The fiction of "just doing it right the first time" is too attractive.*

Why Don’t We Just Call Agile What It Is: Feminist - Hanna Thomas Uose, 3 September 2019  
https://medium.com/@Hanna.Thomas/why-dont-we-just-call-agile-what-it-is-feminist-8bdd9193edba  
*Hanna Thomas Uose argues that we should not only look at tech and manufacturing companies when it comes to Lean-Agile. The Agile Manifesto is inherently subversive, anti-authoritarian, and feminist. The Lean-Agile principles of experimentation, of collaboration, of support and iteration have been a part of progressive social movements since before the Manifesto. In this sense, successful organisations aren’t ones that adopt an 'Agile mindset'. Successful organisations are ones that adopt a feminist, queer, anti-establishment, progressive mindset - one that is flexible, experimental, pushes boundaries, self-organises, and acts in service of community.*

Agile as a Zombie...Noun - Charles Lambdin, 27 January 2020  
https://charleslambdin.com/2020/01/27/agile-as-a-zombienoun/  
*Article that argues that "Agile" is a "nominalization", a "zombie noun". It's used in too abstract a way, divorced from anything sensory-specific. As such, it leads to illusory alignment, because most often the conversation does not proceed to speciffics, to the what, who, and how.*

Agile as Trauma - Dorian Taylor, 8 February 2020  
https://doriantaylor.com/agile-as-trauma  
*Article that argues that the Agile Manifesto is an immune response on the part of programmers to bad management, it's an expression of trauma. As such Agile remains a tactical, technical, and ultimately reactionary movement. To move beyond, it is important to place Agile in a wider context, both historically and in the context of the invariant idiosyncrasies of software development.*

The Agile values 20 years later - Romeu Moura, 12 February 2021  
https://medium.com/@Romeu/the-agile-values-20-years-later-63279a067d80  
*Deep dive into the four core values of Agile 20 years after the Manifesto*

What is Post Agile? - Dave Farley, 11 August, 2021  
https://youtu.be/4OtI6s-rTOE  
*Dave Farley argues that the real Post Agile move is to apply scienctific-style reasoning to software in order to create an engineering discipline for software. That discipline will not replace the Agile Manifesto, but significantly increase our chances to achieve Agile's values and principles.*

There Are No More Early Adopters of Agile - Esther Derby and Matthew Carlson, 29 September 2021, 22 November 2021

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuZ39j7UE20  
*In this podcast and webinar Esther Derby and Matthew Carlson discuss adoption of Agile 20 years after the Manifesto. While the early adopters were motivated by efficiency and effectiveness, the current (i.e. late) adopters are motivated by legitimacy. And this affects what will be a succesful road to adoption and what won't.*

Agility ≠ Speed: Software development benefits from a sense of direction - Kevlin Henney, 22 November 2021  
https://kevlinhenney.medium.com/agility-speed-96057078fe40  
*Kevlin Henney reflects on agility, speed, and velocity. He notes that most velocity metrics are actually speed metrics, which are just utlitisation or estimation metrics. Velocity, however, implies a direction next to a speed. He concludes by saying that agility is not just about that kind of velocity (a sustainable pace in an optimal direction), but also requires the ability to easily change both speed and direction.*

https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2022/01/30/pondering-agile-principles/

https://twitter.com/TheCynefinCo/status/1490704381590781954  
*Dave Snowden talks about rewilding Agile, i.e. restoring balance and integrity to it. With Agile entering the commoditization phase, it has lost lots of its original energy. We can't go back. but we can move forward. The Cynefin framework allows us to do this.*

Agile and the Long Crisis of Software - Miriam Posner, 7 April 2022  
https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/  
*Atricle that outlines the history of software development from the 1960s up to the Agile Manifesto. It then proceeds to argue the current crisis in software development is the Agile crisis. Agile is not delivering the liberatory experience it’s billed as. In a corporate context, its methods and values are also invariably oriented to the imperatives of the corporation, i.e. building the product to support the bottom line.*

Two common threads across companies doing agile - Yvonne Lam, 8 April 2022  
https://twitter.com/yvonnezlam/status/1512209492267581445  
*I'm only a practitioner of agile in the sense that every place I've worked for has done some variety of agile. None of them look alike aside from using similar software tools and not wanting to deal with feedback loops.*

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/participative-design-democracy-trond-hjorteland/  
*Trond Hjorteland explains that Agile was in many ways originally a democratisation movement, where the developers self-organised in teams and took charge of more of the development process. He then argues that a full participative democratisation, i.e. including the design and construction of the organization, is needed for Agile to truly shine.*

*Woody Zuill's eight Agile Maxims*

Agile is a disaster today! - Tom Gilb, 1 September 2022  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKTwsl7oD7U  
*In this short video Tom Gilb says that agile has fallen into disrepute and is performing only slightly better than waterfall. Even worse, we've accepted this as normal. His solution is to study successful projects and then do projects more like that.*

A Patchwork of Contradictions and Confusions: Inside the Software Industry - Merrelyn Emery, January 2023
https://www.socialsciencethatactuallyworks.com/_files/ugd/d59011_f069e39dfe3a4fe6b867244880c2ba29.pdf  
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-working-industry-patchwork-contradictions-trond-hjorteland (article by Trond Hjorteland, 31 March 2023)  
https://podcast.oddly-influenced.dev/episodes/trond-hjorteland-on-a-radical-approach-to-organizational-transformation (podcast interview with Trond Hjorteland, 10 April 2023)  
*Study using as its framework open systems theory (OST) to research what is going on inside the software industry. Its conclusion is that the software industry is a conglomeration of strange combinations of high and low supervision, coordination and control. These uneasy combinations have, therefore, generally not produced well functioning organization either at the operator or managerial levels. After over 20 years of agile, this study shows that agile has failed to produce a coherent industry or sustainable organizations.*
